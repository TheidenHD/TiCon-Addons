1.0.4:

* Added: Tier IV Bonus Modifier

1.0.3:
* Changed: Auto-Repair is now Amelioration (a synonym for "improving"). The mechanics work the same, but recipe has changed
* Changed: Textures for all items + proper 1.9.x+ model support
* Changed: "Officially" supporting 1.10.x+, but also works on 1.9.4 :)
* Removed: Moss Ball in place for the Amelioration Kit. 
* NOTE: Working on a JEI plugin. Until then, to craft the Amelioration Kit with default recipe, do such:

[M] [M] [M]
[M] [E] [M]
[M] [M] [M]

Where [M] is Moss Stone, and E is an enchanted book or item with Mending on it
